In week 2 of the UWA coding bootcamp we have been asked to create our own portfolio page to use as the framework to add future projects to.<br>

## Key Points

As a Web Developer it is important to maintain a consistent online precense. With this portfolio you will be able to get one step closer to knowing who i am as a person, and gives me the basis to add projects that i want to showcase in the future.

## Skills Used

Current features upon deployment will include but not limited to a UI where you click on the navbar and redirected to the appropriate content. A responsive website that is capable of handling different sized screens using media queries. A bit of custom flare using CSS that we have learnt over the last 2 weeks.
