# Web Developer Portfolio

In week 2 of the UWA coding bootcamp we have been asked to create our own portfolio page to use as the framework to add future projects to.

<br><br>

## Key Points

As a Web Developer it is important to maintain a consistent online precense. With this portfolio potential employees will be able to view real world job skills that i possess and can bring to their company, and gives me the basis to add projects that i want to showcase in the future.

<br><br>

## Skills Used

The three main skill areas used to create this project were flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables as well as a lot of google and youtube. I have noticed a massive growth in myself as a coder this week, this being the 8th day i have applied myself to this particular assignment.

<br>

Initially i found myself reviewing class content, googling, youtubing, reading and absorbing as much as i could, and by the back half of the assignment i was able to get myself to a point, also with the additional tutoring of Jain Dixit, where i can grasp a firmer understanding of the box model, flexbox, and css styling, and was able to start free coding without having to use additional references.

<br>

That being said, it was all good to have a site that appeared great on desktop, but time to scale the screen sizes down a notch! Media queries although confusing at first, after a full day of applying myself to getting a firmer grasp of how it all works, i feel like i could now walk into my next assignment with full confidence of tackling this area.

<br><br>

## Current Features

- Nav bar redirects to the correct elements, is fixed for desktop site and static for tablet and mobile viewing as to not clutter the users screen
- About Me section where my portrait photo will shrink to any screen size in the correct ratios and become a column instead of row
- Portfolio section where project tiles will shrink to suit the user screen while maintaining the principal the first tile will always remain larger than the rest, also converts to column on mobile viewing
- Contact Me section not too large for desktop viewing and will give you more space to enter details as screen size is shrunk to tablet and mobile viewing

<br><br>

## Debugging

Here is a few pics of me inspecting the elements to make sure i have made the site accessable for a wide range of devices.<br><br>

## Things i want to work on

Having now coded this full site, and as Jain said to me in tutoring, having common attributes is helpful. This is an area i now feel i can do better on in future, and something i want to better myself in. I have not included a helper.css class, but after a lot of searching through my own code i now understand its importance. I feel like i will be able to code a future website from the ground up using this principal, instead of tackling one section at a time and giving them unique attributes.
